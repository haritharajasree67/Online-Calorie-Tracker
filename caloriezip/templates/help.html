        <h2 style="color:rgba(12, 14, 126, 0.993);">Calorie:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>A calorie is a unit of energy. In nutrition, calories refer to the energy people get from the food and drink they consume, and the energy they use in physical activity.
            Calories are essential for human health. The key is consuming the right amount.
Everyone requires different amounts of energy each day, depending on age, sex, size, and activity level.
People in the United States consume more than 11 percent of their daily calories from fast food.
Foods high in energy but low in nutritional value provide empty calories.The United States government states that the average man needs 2,700 kcal per day and the average woman needs 2,200 kcal per day.

Not everybody needs the same number of calories each day. People have different metabolisms that burn energy at different rates, and some people have more active lifestyles than others.The human body needs calories to survive. Without energy, the cells in the body would die, the heart and lungs would stop, and the organs would not be able to carry out the basic processes needed for living. People absorb this energy from food and drink.

If people consumed only the number of calories needed every day, they would probably have healthy lives. Calorie consumption that is too low or too high will eventually lead to health problems.

The number of calories in food tells us how much potential energy they contain. It is not only calories that are important, but also the substance from which the calories are taken.

        <h2 style="color:rgba(12, 14, 126, 0.993);">BMR:</h2>
        <br>
        <p >Basal metabolic rate measures the calories needed to perform your body's most basic (basal) functions, like breathing, circulation, and cell production. BMR is most accurately measured in a lab setting under very restrictive conditions.
            Once you understand BMR and get a reasonable estimate of your number, you can use it to help you reach or maintain a balanced weight. First, you can try to increase or decrease your basal metabolic rate; then, you can increase the total number of calories you burn each day to help you reach your goal.
